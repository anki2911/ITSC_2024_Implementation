# ITSC_2024_Implementation

This repository contains codebase for the implementation of the paper "A Location Validation Technique to Mitigate GPS Spoofing Attacks in IEEE 802.11 p based Fleet Operator's Network of Electric Vehicles". In this work, we proposed a detection and prevention technique against GPS spoofinf attack. Our proposed technique validates the current GPS location of a vehicle based on its previous location and roadmaps data. We used OpenStreetMap and SUMO simulator to generate the roadmap data from the roadmaps of Singapore. 

For more details you can refer to our publication "A Location Validation Technique to Mitigate GPS Spoofing Attacks in IEEE 802.11p based Fleet Operator's Network of Electric Vehicles", IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2024.
