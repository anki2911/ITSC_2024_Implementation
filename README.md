# ITSC_2024_Implementation

This repository contains codebase for the implementation of the paper "A Location Validation Technique to Mitigate GPS Spoofing Attacks in IEEE 802.11 p based Fleet Operator's Network of Electric Vehicles". In this work, we proposed a detection and prevention technique against GPS spoofinf attack. Our proposed technique validates the current GPS location of a vehicle based on its previous location and roadmaps data. We used OpenStreetMap and SUMO simulator to generate the roadmap data from the roadmaps of Singapore.
